# Homework #1

## Task Overview
Draw a UML diagram of your final project "Personal Assistant" from the previous course. You can use free tools such as [draw.io](https://app.diagrams.net/) or any other application that is convenient for you.

Your previous application currently works in console mode, interacting with the user via console commands. The application should continue to be developed, and the most frequently changed part of the application is usually the user interface (which is currently the console). You need to modify the application code so that it becomes easy to change the way information is presented to the user (displaying user contact cards, notes, a page with information about available commands, etc.). To achieve this, you need to describe an abstract base class for user views and concrete implementations that inherit from the base class and implement the console interface.
