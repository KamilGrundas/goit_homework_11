# Homework #10

In the previous homework assignment, you performed scraping of the website http://quotes.toscrape.com.

Now, you must implement an equivalent of this website in Django.

- Implement the ability to register on the site and log in.
- Implement the ability to add a new author to the site only for a registered user.
- Implement the ability to add a new quote to the service with an indication of the author only for a registered user.
- Instead of uploading data from the MongoDB database, implement the ability to scrape data directly from your site by clicking a specific button on the form and populating the site's database.
- Implement the ability to visit each author's page without user authentication.
- Ensure that all quotes are available for viewing without user authentication.
